title: Safety Alerts
---

Safety Alert! boxes emphasize the importance of
maintaining safety in patient and resident care to pro-
tect patients, residents, family, health care providers,
and the public from accidents and the spread of dis-
ease.

## Prevention of Burns
- The major cause of fires in the home is carelessness with cigarettes. Preventive education is imperative.
- Other causes of burns include hot water from water heaters set higher than 140F (60 C), cooking accidents, space heaters, combustibles such as gasoline and charcoal lighter fluid, steam from radiators, and chemicals.
- Most burns can be prevented. The nurse is in a good position to conduct home safety assessments and to educate people about burn injuries before accidents occur. Home safety measures include using smoke alarms and fire extinguishers. Families should have fire drills, and each family member should know where to go and what to do in case of a fire.
- Local fire departments can inform the public of regional fire codes and perform home safety checks.
- Knowledge of potential sources of burn injury allows problem solving for burn prevention.

Teaching people the proper use of appliances (e.g., space heaters, electrical cords, wiring, outlets, outdoor grills, and water heaters) can prevent burn injury.

## Thromboembolus
Never massage a patient's lower extremities. Thromboembolus can be present without clinical signs and symptoms.

---

## Crutch Safety
Crutch safety involves:
- Proper measurement (with weight on hands, not axillae, to avoid brachial plexus paralysis); leave a 2-inch width between the axillary fold and the arm piece on the crutches
- Rubber tips on the ends of the crutches to prevent slippage
- Adequate muscle strength in the upper extremities to support the patient's weight

---

## Preventing Musculoskeletal Trauma
- Teach patients and community members to take appropriate safety precautions to prevent injuries while at home, at work, when driving, or when participating in sports.
- Be a vocal advocate for personal actions known to reduce injuries such as regularly using seatbelts, driving within posted speed limits, stretching before exercise, using protective athletic equipment (helmets and knee, wrist, and elbow pads), and not combining drinking and driving.
- Encourage older adults to participate in moderate exercise to aid in the maintenance of muscle strength and balance.
- To reduce falls, examine older adults' living environment to rule out the use of scatter rugs, to ensure adequate footwear and lighting, and to clear paths to bathrooms for nighttime use.
- Stress the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.

---

## Strains and Sprains
A strain and a sprain are not the same. Strains are produced by minute muscle tears and overstretching of tendons, whereas sprains are caused by a twisting of the joint.

---

## Appendicitis
- Encourage the patient with abdominal pain to see a health care provider and to avoid self-treatment, particularly the use of laxatives and enemas.
- The increased peristalsis of laxatives and enemas may cause perforation of the appendix.
- Until the patient is seen by a health care provider, he or she should remain NPO to ensure the stomach is empty in case surgery is needed.
- An ice bag may be applied to the right lower quadrant to decrease the flow of blood to the area and impede the inflammatory process.
- Heat is never used because it could cause the appendix to rupture.
- Surgery is usually performed as soon as a diagnosis is made.

## Prevention of Acute Viral Hepatitis
### Hepatitis A
- Hand washing is imperative. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted when people eat food that is contaminated with fecal material (called "fecal-oral transmission"). Teach patients the importance of good hand hygiene after using the bathroom or changing a diaper, as well as proper food preparation, to prevent the spread of HAV. There are several documented cases of HAV being linked to food preparation and handling in restaurants. 
- The best protection against HAV transmission is the two-dose HAV vaccine.
### Hepatitis B
- Wash hands.
- One of the best preventive measures against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the HBV vaccine.
- Hepatitis B is transmitted via blood and body fluids.
- Children younger than 18 years of age are routinely vaccinated today.
- People who are at risk for the virus, such as health care workers, should be vaccinated.
- People who play or work in inner-city parks and playgrounds are at risk for exposure to HBV from garbage containers and used needles and syringes. They should be vaccinated, as should men who have sex with men, individuals who use illicit IV drugs, and those who travel to areas with a high infection rate. Individuals who are traveling internationally should be vaccinated.
- People who are positive for HBV should not donate blood, organs, or tissue, and should not breastfeed.
- Ensure proper disposal of needles.
- Use standard precautions when handling blood products.
- Use needleless IV access devices if available.
### Hepatitis C
- Wash hands.
- Hepatitis C virus is transmitted by needle sharing among illicit IV drug users.
- Other significant risk factors include receipt of clotting factor made before 1987, hemodialysis, receipt of blood or solid organs donated before 1992, maternal-fetal transmission, and multiple or infected sex partners.
- Ensure proper disposal of needles.
- Use standard precautions when handling blood products.
- Use needleless IV access devices if available.
### Hepatitis D
- Modes of hepatitis D virus (HDV) transmission are similar to those of HBV. Sexual transmission of HDV is less effcient than for HBV. Educate patients regarding risky behavior.
### Hepatitis E
- Educate patients to avoid drinking water or beverages with ice in areas with uncertain water quality. They should refrain from eating raw shellfish and avoid raw produce unless it is prepared with purified water.
- Hepatitis E is most often seen in Southeast and Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Mexico.
### Hepatitis G
- Hepatitis G has been detected in blood samples in Europe, Asia, and Australia.
- Transmission of hepatitis G virus occurs when tainted injectable drugs are used; tainted blood, organs, or tissues are received; or unsafe methods are used for tattooing or body piercing.

## Aplastic Anemia
### Prevent Infection
- Use good hand hygiene technique.
- Avoid contact with those who have infection.
- Avoid sharing eating utensils and bath linens.
- Bathe or shower every day (or every other day if skin is dry); keep perineal area clean.
- Use good oral hygiene.
- Eliminate intake of raw meats, fruits, or vegetables.
- Immediately report signs of infection to health care provider.
### Prevent Hemorrhage
- Observe for signs such as blood in urine or stool and petechiae, and report these to health care provider.
- Use a soft toothbrush or swab for mouth care.
- Keep mouth clean and free of debris.
- Avoid enemas or other rectal insertions.
- Avoid picking or blowing the nose forcefully.
- Avoid trauma, falls, bumps, and cuts; avoid contact sports.
- Avoid use of aspirin or over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin preparations (anticoagulant effect).
- Use an electric razor.
- Use adequate lubrication and gentleness during sexual intercourse.
- Avoid intramuscular injections.
### Prevent Fatigue
- Take frequent rest periods between activities of daily living (ADLs).
- Avoid excessive workload or heavy lifting, and ask for assistance with strenuous activity.
- Increase time necessary for routine care.
- Decrease activity if shortness of breath, dizziness, or sensation of heaviness in extremities occurs.
- Report signs of increased fatigue.

## Patient Anticoagulant Therapy
1. Teach patient receiving oral warfarin the requirements for frequent follow-up with blood tests (PT, INR) to assess blood clotting and whether a change in drug dosage is required.
2. Teach patient side effects and adverse effects of anticoagulant therapy requiring medical attention.
- Any bleeding that does not stop after a reasonable time (usually 10 to 15 minutes)
- Blood in urine or stool or black, tarry stools
- Unusual bleeding from gums, throat, skin, or nose, or heavy menstrual bleeding
- Severe headaches or stomach pains
- Weakness, dizziness, mental status changes
- Vomiting blood
- Cold, blue, or painful feet
3. Avoid any trauma or injury that might cause bleeding (e.g., vigorous brushing of teeth, contact sports, inline roller skating).
4. Do not take aspirin-containing drugs or NSAIDs, due to the blood-thinning effects these drugs contribute.
5. Limit alcohol intake to small amounts. Alcohol interferes with metabolism of the drug.
6. Wear a medical-alert bracelet or necklace indicating what anticoagulant is being taken.
7. Avoid marked changes in eating habits, such as dramatically increasing foods high in vitamin K (e.g., broccoli, spinach, kale, greens). Do not take supplemental vitamin K.
8. Inform all health care providers, including dentist, of anticoagulant therapy.
9. Correct dosing is essential and supervision may be required (e.g., for patients experiencing confusion).
10. Do not use herbal products that may alter coagulation (see Complementary and Alternative Therapies box).

## An SaO<sub>2</sub> of Less Than 70% Is Considered Life-Threatening
Arterial oxygen saturation can be quickly and noninvasively determined through pulse oximetry. Severe circulatory problems may diminish the accuracy
ofthe reading. If oximetry results seem questionable, the health care provider usually orders ABG tests. A pulse oximeter can detect a change within 6 seconds. To get optimal results, remember these points:
- Do not attach the probe to an extremity that has a blood pressure cuff or arterial catheter in place; these devices reduce blood flow.
- Place the probe over a pulsating vascular bed.
- While the probe is on the patient, protect it from strong light (such as direct sunlight), which can affect the reading.
- Avoid excess patient movement to ensure accuracy.
- Remember that hypothermia, hypotension, and vasoconstriction can affect readings.

## Epistaxis and Blood Pressure
If the patient has an episode of epistaxis or complains of frequent episodes of epistaxis, check his or her blood pressure!

---

## Emergency Care for Hypoglycemic Reaction
### Immediate Treatment - If Conscious
- Give patient 10 to 20 g of quick-acting carbohydrate in some form, such as 4 to 6 oz of orange juice or a regular soft drink (not a diet drink); half of a
candy bar; commercially prepared concentrated dextrose tablets or glucose paste; one tube of icing gel (small); 2 tsp of sugar or honey; six jelly beans or
gumdrops; five or six pieces of hard candy or other roll candy; four animal crackers; or one granola bar. Offer another 5 to 20 g ofquick-acting carbohydrate
in 15 minutes if no relief is obtained.
- Give patient additional food, a longer-acting carbohydrate (e.g., slice of bread, crackers with peanut butter), after symptoms subside to maintain glucose
level after the quick-acting (simple) carbohydrate has been metabolized.
### Immediate Treatment - If Unconscious
- Squeeze one tube of glucagon gel between the cheek and the gums (in the buccal space), or give glucagon 0.5 to 1 mg subQ or 1M; get patient to hospital.
Hospitalized patients may receive an IV bolus of 20 mL of 50% glucose or 50 mL of 20% glucose; glucagon may be given intravenously. Patient may need
IV 10% or 20% glucose at 100 mL/hour to follow.
### Nursing Interventions During and After Hypoglycemic Episode
- Stay with the patient; check vital signs and do fingerstick blood glucose levels.
- Monitor for worsening of condition or relief of symptoms.
- If patient becomes unconscious, administer glucagon buccally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or intravenously.
- Be certain patient ingests food such as milk, six crackers with peanut butter, or one slice of cheese and six crackers after symptoms end (if able).
- Observe closely for 1 to 2 hours after cessation of symptoms.
- Notify health care provider about the hypoglycemic reaction.
- Assess reason the reaction may have occurred.

## Emergency Care for Hypoglycemic Reaction (Diabetic Ketoacidosis)
### Usual Treatment During Acute Stage
The nurse would expect the following orders per the health care provider:
- Start an IV, using a large-gauge IV catheter, and begin fluid replacement, usually with normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) at 1 L/hour, until blood
pressure is stabilized and urinary output is 30 to 60 mL/hour. When blood glucose levels approach 250 mg/dL, add 5% dextrose to the fluid regimen to
prevent hypoglycemia.
- Give regular insulin (the only kind that can be given intravenously) as a piggyback infusion, using 100 units of regular insulin in 500 mL of normal saline.
Administer the infusion with a pump controller. Adjust the infusion rate to obtain and maintain desired blood glucose levels.
- Determine blood glucose level hourly (SMBG method or venous sample).
- Provide IV replacement of potassium to help move insulin into cells; monitor serum potassium.
- Monitor arterial blood gas (ABG) values specifically to monitor for acidosis.
- Administer oxygen via nasal cannula or nonrebreather mask to maintain oxygen saturation at 95 % or greater.
- Monitor cardiac status, with central venous pressure and Swan-Ganz monitoring if available.
- Insert Foley catheter and monitor 1&0 hourly.
- Assess vital signs and neurologic status.
### Nursing Interventions During and After Diabetic Ketoacidosis
- Keep airway open (patent).
- Maintain patent IV infusion at prescribed rate.
- Keep accurate 1&0 record.
- Do accurate blood testing for glucose and urine testing for acetone.
- Monitor vital signs frequently, and assess cardiac status on monitor.
- Assess breath sounds for fluid overload.
- Assess level of consciousness frequently, and perform neurologic checks as ordered.
- Assess the cause of DKA.

## Sexually Transmitted Infections
- Teach "safe" sex practices including abstinence, monogamy with an uninfected partner, avoidance of certain high-risk sexual practices, and
use of condoms and other barriers to limit contact with potentially infectious body fluids or lesions.
- All sexually active women should be screened for cervical cancer. Women with a history of STIS are at greater risk for cervical cancer than
women without this history.
- Inform patients of the new HPV vaccine for girls and women ages 9 to 18 years to prevent HPV infection and the precancerous changes that
lead to cervical cancer.
- Instruct patients in hygiene measures, such as washing and urinating after intercourse to rid the body of causative organisms.
- Explain the importance of taking all antibiotics as prescribed. Symptoms often improve after 1 or 2 days of therapy, but organisms may still
be present.
- Teach patients about the need for treatment of sexual partners with antibiotics to prevent transmission of disease.
- Instruct patients to abstain from sexual intercourse during treatment and to use condoms when sexual activity is resumed, to prevent
spread of infection and reinfection.
- Explain the importance of follow-up examination and reculture at least once after treatment (if appropriate) to confirm complete cure and
to prevent relapse.
- Allow patients and partners to verbalize concerns to clarify areas that need explanation.
- Instruct patients about symptoms of complications and the need to report problems to ensure proper follow-up and early treatment of
reinfection.
- Explain precautions to take, such as being monogamous; asking potential partners about sexual history; avoiding sex with partners who use
IV drugs or who have visible oral, inguinal, genital, perineal, or anal lesions; using condoms; and voiding and washing genitalia after coitus to
reduce the occurrence of reinfection.
- Inform patients regarding their state of infectivity to prevent a false sense of security, which might result in careless sexual practices and
poor personal hygiene.

## Eye Safety Measures
- Do not rinse eyes with unprescribed solutions.
- Discard any ophthalmic solution that is cloudy, discolored, contains particles, or that has been open for longer than 3 months.
- Do not self-treat an eye inflammation with a medication prescribed for a previous eye disorder.
- To avoid eye strain:
- Use a good light for reading or doing work that requires careful visual focus.
- When reading or focusing eyes for long periods, look at distant objects for a few minutes at repeated intervals to rest eyes.
- Avoid rubbing the eyes.
- Wash hands before and after touching the eyes.
- Wear safety glasses when engaging in activities that could injure the eyes. If injury occurs, seek immediate medical attention.
- Wear dark glasses for prolonged exposure to bright light (prolonged daylight exposure, activities in the snow, or on the water).
- Flush eyes immediately for 15 to 20 minutes or longer with cool water when any irritating substances are introduced.
- Do not attempt to remove foreign bodies from the cornea; cover the eye with an eye shield (e.g., small paper cup) to prevent excessive move-
ment or touching of the eye. Seek medical attention immediately.
- If a speck of dust blows in the eye, pull the upper lid over the lower lid and let the tears wash the speck to the inner canthus (corner of the eye)
or lower lid, where it may be safely removed. Irrigate the eye with cool tap water, if necessary.
- Eye makeup should be replaced every 3 months and with every eye infection to prevent the growth of bacteria or reinfection.
- Never share eye makeup, and when sampling makeup in stores use only fresh applicators and samples that have not been contaminated by
multiple users. (The safest choice is to avoid store samples altogether.)

## Preventing Neurologic Injuries
- One of the best ways to prevent head injuries is to prevent car and motorcycle accidents.
- Become active in campaigns that promote safe driving. Speak to driver's education classes regarding the danger of unsafe driving and driving
after drinking alcohol or taking drugs.
- The use of seatbelts in cars and the use of helmets for riding on motorcycles are the most effective measures for increasing survival after
accidents.
- Individual states have legislation requiring the use of automobile safety devices for both children and adults.
- Recommend the wearing of protective helmets when engaging in potentially risky activities such as bike riding, horseback riding, and
motorcycling.
- Encourage swimmers of all ages to refrain from diving into shallow water or areas in which water depth is unknown.

---

## Treating the Patient With a Hypersensitivity Reaction
- List all of the patient's allergies on the chart, the nursing care plan, and the medication record.
- After an allergic disorder is diagnosed, therapeutic treatment is aimed at reducing exposure to the offending allergen; treating the symp-
toms; and, if necessary, desensitizing the person through immunotherapy.
- All health care workers must be prepared for the rare but life-threatening anaphylactic reaction, which requires immediate medical and
nursing interventions.
- Instruct the patient to wear a medical alert bracelet listing the particular drug allergy.
- For a patient allergic to insect stings, commercial bee sting kits containing epinephrine and a tourniquet are available. Teach the patient to
apply the tourniquet and self-inject the subcutaneous epinephrine. The patient should wear a medical alert bracelet and carry a bee sting kit
whenever he or she goes outdoors.

---

## Neutropenic Precautions
- Monitor neutrophil count to identify signs of infection.
- Assess for presence of chills. Measure vital signs every 4 hours because fever may be the only indication of infection and septic shock.
- Report temperature elevations of more than 100.40 F (380 C) to the health care provider immediately so that antibiotic therapy can be initiated promptly
to help avoid the rapidly lethal effects of infection.
- Institute good hand hygiene technique with antiseptic solution for all people in contact with patient; place patient in private room; limit or screen visitors
and hospital staff members with colds or potentially communicable illnesses to prevent transmission of pathogens to patient.
- Teach patient and family necessary personal hygiene techniques (e.g., hand hygiene, oral care, skin hygiene, pulmonary hygiene, and potential infection
risks).
- Avoid invasive procedures (e.g., venipuncture, urinary catheter) as much as possible.
- Administer hematopoietic growth factors (e.g., granulocyte colony—stimulating factors such as filgrastim [Neupogen] or pegfilgrastim [Neulasta]) to
increase patient's WBC count and reduce infection risk during periods of neutropenia. Provide neutropenic diet (avoid fresh fruits and vegetables because
of presence of microscopic pathogens in uncooked produce). The patient's visitors should be discouraged from bringing fresh flowers or live plants to the
patient's room. Mites, gnats, and other microscopic organisms could be a potential source of infection for the patient.
