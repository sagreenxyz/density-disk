## Anatomy and Physiology
- Anatomy is the study, classification, and description of structures and organs of the body. Physiology explains the function of the various structures and how they interrelate.
- The normal anatomical position of the body is standing erect with the face and the palms of the hands forward.
- For the purposes of study, the body is divided into three imaginary planes: sagittal, coronal (frontal), and transverse.
- The body is divided into two large cavities: the dorsal and the ventral. The dorsal cavity contains the cranial and spinal cavities. The ventral cavity contains the thoracic,
abdominal, and pelvic cavities.
- For the purposes of study, the abdominal region is divided into nine regions: right hypochondriac region, epigastric region, left hypochondriac region, right lumbar region,
umbilical region, left lumbar region, right inguinal region, hypogastric region, and left inguinal region.
- The cell's major structures are the cytoplasm, nucleus, ER, ribosomes, mitochondria, lysosomes, Golgi apparatus, and centrioles.
- Organization is a fundamental characteristic of body structure.
- Cells are considered to be the smallest living units of structure and function in the body. Although long recognized as the simplest units of living matter, cells are extremely
complex.
- Tissues are groups of similar cells that work together to perform a specific function.
- Organs are structures made up of two or more kinds of tissues organized so they can perform a more complex function than they could alone.
- Systems are groups of organs arranged so they can perform a more complex function than they could alone.
- To receive nutrition and oxygen and to rid itself of wastes, the cell performs passive transport (diffusion, osmosis, filtration) and active transport (phagocytosis and pinocytosis,
as well as the sodium-potassium pump and the calcium pump).
- The body is composed of four main types of tissues: epithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous tissues.
- The major systems of the body are integumentary, skeletal, muscular, nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular (circulatory), lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, urinary, and
reproductive.

## Surgical Patient
- The time before, during, and after surgery is the perioperative period. It is divided into preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases.
- Perioperative nursing interventions take place before, during, and after surgery.
- The ability to tolerate surgery is influenced by nursing interventions, previous illness, and past surgeries.
- Older adult patients are at surgical risk from their declining physiologic status.
- All medications taken before surgery are automatically discontinued after surgery unless a physician reorders the medications, except for medications for long-term conditions
such as phenytoin for seizure control.
- Family members are important in assisting patients with physical limitations and in providing emotional support during the postoperative recovery.
- Preoperative assessment of vital signs and physical findings provides an important baseline for comparing perioperative and postoperative assessment data.
- A patient's feelings about surgery can have a significant effect on relationships with nursing staff and the patient's ability to participate in care.
- Nursing diagnoses of the surgical patient may require interventions during one or all phases of surgery.
- Informed consent should not be obtained if a patient is confused, unconscious, mentally incompetent, or under the influence of sedatives. Know agency policy.
- Structured preoperative teaching positively influences postoperative recovery.
- A routine preoperative checklist is a guide for final preparation of the patient before surgery.
- Nurses in the OR focus on protecting the patient from potential harm.
- Assessment of the postoperative patient centers on the body systems most likely to be affected by anesthesia, immobilization, and surgical trauma.
- Because a surgical patient's condition may change rapidly during immediate postoperative recovery, monitor the patient's status at least every 15 minutes.
- The PACU nurse reports to the nurse on the postoperative unit information pertaining to the patient's current physical status and risk for postoperative complications.
- From the time of admission, plan for the surgical patient's discharge.
- Discharge planning identifies home care measures to promote recovery that involve both patient and family.
- Evaluation of all perioperative care is at times diffcult, since the patient may be discharged from the nurse's care before the outcome is certain.

## Integumantary
- The skin, including nails, hair, and glands, makes up the integumentary system.
- The main functions of the integumentary system are protection, temperature regulation, and vitamin D synthesis.
- The two layers of true skin are the epidermis and dermis.
- The layer of tissue directly beneath the skin is the subcutaneous layer; it is composed of adipose tissue and loose connective tissue.
- The sudoriferous (sweat) glands release perspiration through the skin.
- The sebaceous (oil) glands secrete sebum, which lubricates the skin and prevents invasion of bacteria through the skin.
- Any injury to the skin poses a threat to a person's self-concept.
- It is important to establish a therapeutic relationship to meet the patient's psychological needs.
- Most skin disorders are not contagious and are rarely fatal. They are often chronic.
- Sterile technique and isolation techniques are required with any open, draining lesion.
- Wet dressings need to be checked frequently. Constant moisture softens the skin and contributes to skin maceration.
- Medicines must be applied to clean skin.
- The nursing interventions for a skin disorder depend on the cause; however, common problems are decreased skin integrity, risk for infec-
tion, lack of knowledge concerning the disease, and ineffective coping.
- A primary nursing intervention is to teach the patient about the mode of transmission of the particular disease.
- The assessment of patients with skin disorders includes collection of both subjective and objective data.
- Wet dressings and baths may be done to soothe, vasoconstrict, debride, or decrease pruritus.
- Before initiating heat and cold therapy, understand normal body responses to local temperature variations, assess the integrity of the body
part, determine the patient's ability to sense temperature, and ensure proper operation of equipment.
- Prevent malignant skin diseases by educating the public about causes.
- Burns can be classified by depth and TBSA involved.
- The pathophysiology and care of burns involve three stages: the hypovolemic, or emergent, phase; the acute, or diuretic, phase; and the long-
term, or rehabilitation, phase.
- The three phases of burn care overlap, with different goals and nursing interventions in each.
- A primary nursing intervention for the burn patient in the emergent phase is to establish and maintain an open airway.
- The treatment method for a burn patient depends on age, body surface area involved, location, depth, and other diseases present.
- The primary causes of death in burn victims are hypovolemic shock in the first 72 hours and infection during the acute phase.
- Suspect inhalation injury if the burn injury occurred in a closed or confined area.
- A treatment for burns is use of temporary skin substitutes derived from human fibroblast cells.

## Musculoskeletal
- The skeletal system has five basic functions: support of the body, protection of internal organs, movement of the body, storage of minerals,
and blood cell formation.
- The skeleton is divided into the axial and the appendicular skeletons. The axial skeleton is composed of the skull, vertebral column, and
thorax. The appendicular skeleton is composed of the upper extremities, lower extremities, shoulder girdle, and pelvic girdle.
- The three types of joints and their movement are (1) synarthrosis: no movement; (2) amphiarthrosis: slight movement; and (3) diarthrosis:
free movement.
- Joints hold the bones together and allow movement and flexibility. Differences in the structure determine the amount of flexibility.
- Some ofthe more common movements that the body produces are flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, rotation, supination, pronation,
dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion.
- The bones and joints provide the framework of the body, but the muscles are necessary for movement. Movement results from contraction
and relaxation of the individual muscles.
- An ESR is the most objective laboratory test for determining the severity of RA.
- RA affects a young population (ages 30 to 5 5 years) with crippling changes in the synovial membrane of the joints.
- Salicylates and NSAIDs are used to treat RA and osteoarthritis.
- Osteoarthritis is a DJD that affects the population older than 40 years of age and causes articular cartilage degeneration.
- Porous and brittle bones caused by a lack of calcium are one of the physiologic changes noted in osteoporosis.
- Osteoporosis-related fractures occur in one in two women, compared with one in eight men, over the course of a lifetime.
- Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are surgical procedures used to relieve pain in women with osteoporosis who do not respond to other pain
management programs.
- Arthroplasty procedures (such as hip and knee arthroplasty) are commonly performed on patients suffering from severe arthritis.
- Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, also referred to as partial knee replacement, is performed on patients who have only one ofthe com-
partments of the knee affected by arthritis.
- Nursing intervention specific to the care of a patient suffering from a fractured hip involves maintaining abduction of the affected leg.
- Fractured hip fixation devices—such as hip prosthetic implant, plate and screw fixation, and telescoping nail fixation—require some degree
of non—weight bearing for 6 weeks to 3 months.
- The use of antacids and proton pump inhibitors increases a patient's risk of hip fractures.
- A significant postoperative nursing intervention for a patient with an amputation is proper care of the stump to facilitate the use of a
prosthetic device.
- Herniated nucleus pulposus is seen most often in the cervical and lumbar spinal regions and can be treated surgically (laminectomy and
spinal fusion) or medically (medication, traction, and physical therapy).
- Osteogenic sarcoma is a common primary malignant tumor seen in young people; it can metastasize to the lungs.
- Compartment syndrome, shock, fat embolism, gas gangrene, thromboembolus, and osteomyelitis are complications resulting from a frac-
tured bone.
- Petechiae on the conjunctiva of the eye, the neck, the chest, or the axillary region is a typical sign of a fat embolism.
- External fixation devices such as casts, braces, metal pins, and skeletal and skin traction are used to hold bone fragments in normal position.
- Whether the casting material is plaster of Paris or a synthetic material, proper drying, cleansing, handling, and assessing are required to
prevent patient complications.
- The nurse caring for a patient in traction is responsible for knowing (1) the purpose of the traction (traction applied for fractures must be
continuous), (2) the equipment needed and appropriate safety measures, (3) the amount of weight ordered, and (4) the patient's understand-
ing of the traction.
- Crutches, canes, walkers, and the Roll-A-Bout are used as gait enhancers for patients with altered mobility.
- Crutch walking involving the three-point gait is most commonly used for patients wearing leg casts.

## Gastrointestinal
- The digestive tract begins with the mouth, extends through the thoracic and abdominal cavities, and ends with the anus.
- The major processes of digestion and absorption take place in the small intestine.
- The large intestine is responsible for the preparation and evacuation of feces.
- Diet therapy has an important role in the treatment of GI disorders.
- Treatment of esophageal disorders often involves providing the patient with a means of eating, in addition to treating the disorder.
- Common causes of gastric disorders are alcohol, tobacco, aspirin, and antiinflammatory agents.
- Duodenal ulcers are the most common type of peptic ulcer disease.
- A relatively new diagnostic examination is capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule equipped with a camera to visualize the small intestine and diagnose
diseases such as Crohn's disease.
- Surgical procedures are available as alternatives to the traditional ileostomy and colostomy.
- A nursing goal for the patient with an ileostomy or a colostomy is to foster patient independence in daily care when the patient demonstrates readiness.
- Keeping the surgical area free of contamination is of primary importance after rectal surgery.
- The approximate location of GI bleeding may be determined by the characteristics of the emesis or the fecal material.
- Explain the purpose of any diagnostic procedure, how the procedure is performed, and the preparation necessary for the procedure, and help the patient understand the results.
- Helicobacter pylori has been identified in more than 70% of patients with gastric ulcers and 95% ofthose with duodenal ulcers.
- Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease have a greater risk of developing cancer of the bowel.
- Early detection of cancer in the GI system facilitates early treatment and a better prognosis.
- An NG tube is inserted to keep the stomach empty until peristalsis resumes after a general anesthetic or any condition that interferes with peristalsis.
- Effective postoperative care begins with patient teaching during the preoperative period.
